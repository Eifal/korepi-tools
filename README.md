# Korepi Tools

Some Korepi related stuff that I wrote while learning how to hack

## How to Use

Launch Korepi once without any license, and it should give you a hardware ID.
Then run the `license_gen.js` which will asks you for your HWID and generates a license file to use.
**Copy** (don't cut) the license file into the same folder where the exe is located.
Then start `server.js` and launch Korepi.
